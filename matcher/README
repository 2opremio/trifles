After a tweet ( https://twitter.com/veorq/status/637616767058223104 ), I wanted
to see if my suggestion if generating a finite state machine with ragel was
actually faster.

Turns out it wasn't.

At least not for only 1000 keys anyway.  Ragel segfaulted when trying to create
a machine for 200,000 keys. :(

I also tested armon/go-radix and cloudflare/ahocorasick.

My test keys were the top 1000 email domains from the Linkedin leak a while ago.
I've been using it as a reasonable real-world test set every since I watched
John Graham-Cumming's talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_41bkNr7eik

Anyways, searching 200000 inputs for the thousand keys 10 times; we see the ranking
